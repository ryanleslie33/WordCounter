#### By _**Ryan Leslie**_

## Description

_This application will ask the user the enter in a word, after the user enters that word it will then ask the user to enter a sentence. Once the user has entered a sentence it will look inside of that sentence to see if the word they entered has appeared anywhere in that sentence even if it is just part of the word in sentence that matches. How ever many times the word they entered appears in the sentence it outputs a count. So if the users word was "DOG", and their sentence said dog three times, it will display a count of 3 and then start all over again. The application is not case or character sensitive.}_

## Specifications

*_user is asked to input a word of their choice.
This would be a good way to get started and capture that word as a string and list it as a variable so it will be able to identify in a sentence.

*_user is asked to provide a sentence.
Just getting the output to be a sentence with each word as a string I think would be the first step to being able to isolate each word to check for the inputted word.

*_After user inputs the sentence the app will take the sentence and split each word into its own string.
this is a good step because each word has to be its own string in order for it to be identified.

*_Once user input sentence is split the app will look for the specific word input they used and run a count for each time it is displayed.
Simply using an if statement to see the if inputted word matches anywhere inside the sentence.

*_The user output will then be the count for how many times the word appears inside the sentence.
Making variable named result to be the final count and final output.
